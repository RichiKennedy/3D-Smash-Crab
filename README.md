# 3D-Smash-Crab
Brief: Build an iteractive 3D game 

Timeframe: Four weeks.

Description: This was a team project with an individual level build. 
We decided to pick a beach theme fo our game and then individually would decide how we would build our own level.
I decided to create a Whack-a-mole type game tho i created it with a crab instead, using A-frame.


Key Learnings:

The essentials of Aframe:

  Event handling.

  Handling states and accessing them across components.
            
  Using props to pass data between components.

  Developing logical file structure.
